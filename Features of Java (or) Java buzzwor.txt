* Features of Java (or) Java buzzwords :-
There are many features of Java. They are also known as Java buzzwords.
The features of Java given below
• Simple:

According to sun, Java language is simple because
→ Syntax is based on C and c++.
→ removed many confusing and rarely used features
e.g. Explicit pointers, operator overloading etc.
→ removed many confusing ava
e.g, Explicit pointers, operator overloading etc.
→ No need to remove unreferenced objects because there is automatic garbage collection in Java.
→ It eliminates the complexities of C and c++, therefore Java has been made simple.

• Object-oriented:

→ object-oriented means wise organize our software as a combination of different types of objects that Contains both data and behaviour.
→ object-oriented programming (Oops) is a Methodology that simplify software development and maintenance by providing some concepts & redes.
→ The basic concepts of OOPs are:
* Object
* class
* Inheritance
* polymorphism
* Abstraction
* Encapsulation

• platform independent:

→ There are two types of platforms: software-based and hardware-based. Java provides software-based platform.
→Java code can be run on multiple platforms
e.g. Windows, Linux, Mac ios and etc.
→Java code is compiled by the compiler and
converted into byte code. This byte code is a platform independent code.
→ It is achieved by JVM (Java Virtual Machine).
The philosophy of Java is "Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA).

• Secured:

→Java is secured because Java does not use explicit pointers and All Java programs runs inside the virtual Machine Sand box.
→ Java uses the public key encryption system for providing security.

- Robust:

→ Robust simply means strong. Java is robust programming language because
* Java uses strong Memory Management.
* There are lack of pointers that avoids Security problem.
* There is automatic garbage collection in Java.
* There is exception handling and type checking
